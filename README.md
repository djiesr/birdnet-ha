### Installing the Package

1. Download the `packages/birdnet-pi-package.yaml` file
2. Replace `{{ birdnet_pi_ip }}` with your BirdNET-Pi device IP address
3. Copy the file to your Home Assistant `config/packages/` directory
4. Add the following to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
homeassistant:
  packages: !include_dir_named packages
```

5. Restart Home Assistant

### Package Configuration

Before using the package, make sure to:

1. **Replace the IP address**: Edit the package file and replace all instances of `{{ birdnet_pi_ip }}` with your actual BirdNET-Pi device IP address
2. **Configure media players**: Update the `media_player.living_room_speaker` reference in the package with your actual media player entity
3. **Adjust notification settings**: Modify the notification entity in automations to match your setup

### Package Components
